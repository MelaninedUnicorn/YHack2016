With an increased expansion into India on the horizon, management has revised its capital expenditures to increase by $2.5 billion in 2017 and 2018.",
        class: "Bearish",
        reason: "In your Discounted Cash Flow model, remember that an increase in capital expenditure will decrease your target price estimation. With only a 1.2% decrease in COGS margin, this will not be sufficient to offset the negative effect on your future cash flow",

        class: "Bearish",

However, the rate cut commentary is very dangerous and could have an impact on the market on the short-term. Therefore, both neutral & bearish should be expected given the fact that no further details are included about the given economic situation.",
